Basic Guidlines to write a Java Program :

1. Class name should start with Capital Letter (Upper Case).

public class Test {
}
2. any variable needs to be start with lower case and follow the camel case

Camel case :  rakeshKumarGedam

3. Methods and variables or anything needs to be define inside the class that
means after the open { and before }.

Example :

public class Test { --- After this we can write anything inside the class.
}
4. Method name should always start with lower case and follow the camel case
conventions :

Example :

public class Test {

public void getSample() {
}
}
}

5. in methods if we need to pass any inputs it always inside the () and logic of
 method should always be inside the method that means { of method.

 Example :

 public class Test {
 public void getSample(String input, int number, String address) {

 All method logic goes here.
 }
 }
 }

6. Every Statement in java should be ends with terminator which is ;.
Example :

 public class Test {
 public void getSample(String input, int number, String address) {

 System.out.println("Test"); <====== Semicolon terminator
 }
 }
 }
